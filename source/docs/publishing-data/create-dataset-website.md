# Publishing your research

MaterialsCommons uses the term "Dataset" for published data. A dataset is a subset of the data in your project. It
is made up of the files, samples, processes, and workflows that you choose to publish. To publish your research
you will need to create a new dataset or modify an existing one. Clicking in the sidebar on the "Publish" link
will take you to a page listing your current datasets. You can create new datasets from this page.

Clicking on "+ Create Dataset" allows you to create a new dataset. Clicking on existing datasets gives you the
opportunity to edit an existing dataset.
