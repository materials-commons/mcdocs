# Publishing your research

MaterialsCommons uses the term "Dataset" for published data. A dataset is a subset of the data in your project. It
is made up of the files, samples, processes, and workflows that you choose to publish. To publish your research
you will need to create a new dataset or modify an existing one. Clicking in the sidebar on the "Publish" link
will take you to a page listing your current datasets. You can create new datasets from this page.

Clicking on "+ Create Dataset" allows you to create a new dataset. Clicking on existing datasets gives you the
opportunity to edit an existing dataset.

### Creating a new dataset

The create dataset screen contains the required and optional fields for a dataset. On this screen you will need to give the
dataset a name. The system will automatically fill in the Authors field with the names of all the people who have access
to your project. This field can be edited.

The experiments field lets you quickly fill out the other assets (workflows, samples and processes) by selecting
the experiment(s) that this dataset will pull from. When you select one or more experiments the system will automatically
bring over the workflows, samples and processes from those experiments.

When you are done click on "Save And Add Assets". This will take you to a screen where you can choose the files,
workflows, samples and processes to include in the dataset.

### Add Workflow

The workflow tab lets you select, or de-select the workflows you would like to include in this dataset. If there are
workflows that are checked that you would like to exclude you can de-select them. You can also add workflows from the
project that are not already selected.

### Adding Files

The files tab lets you select files and directories to include in the workflow. Selecting a directory will automatically
select anything below that directory. You can click into a selected directory and de-select files you do not want to
include.

### Adding Samples

The samples tab lets you select or de-select samples that you would like to include in this dataset.

### Add Processes

If your project has processes in it, this tab will allow you to select or de-select processes to include.

### Assign a DOI

Materials Commons lets you assign a DOI to your dataset. It will take care of registering this DOI and making it
searchable. If your dataset doesn't have a DOI then click the "Assign DOI" link.

After clicking "Assign DOI" the dataset page will update to show the newly minted DOI.
