# Publishing

MaterialsCommons allows you to publish your research online. You have control over what is published and can always edit
or change it as needed. You publish the research in a project. When you publishing using MaterialsCommons your files
are made available as a Zip archive as well as through Globus. You can have MaterialsCommons associate a DOI with your
published research. It will manage that DOI for you, including registration and ensuring it is in a searchable index.
In this way you can use DOI in a paper. This will allow readers of the paper to easily find your published data.
