# Downloading Datasets

Materials Commons provides two ways you can download a dataset. If the dataset isn't too large a Zip File of the dataset
will be created that you can download.

In addition to the Zip File all datasets are available for download using Globus. For large datasets this has the benefit
of providing a reliable download that can run in the background. In the screenshot below you can see the two different
links to download the dataset.
