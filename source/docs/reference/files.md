# Files
You can store and retrieve your files in MaterialsCommons. You can use associate files with Samples, Processes, Experiments
and Projects. In this way you can better describe the relationships in your research and how a piece of data relates
back to your processing steps and samples.

### Globus
If you have a large number of files, or large files to upload then see the [Globus section](../globus). Globus
is designed for large file uploads. Otherwise see "Add Files" below to easily upload a small number of files to
MaterialsCommons.

### Add Files
You can upload files directly in MaterialsCommons. To use the MaterialsCommons uploader click on the "+Add Files" link.
If you have a large number of files to upload, or files that are
large in size, then you should use Globus for your uploads. The MaterialsCommons uploader is useful for small numbers
and small sizes. You can upload files up to 75MB in size from this page.

### Create Directory
You can create a new directory in MaterialsCommons file tree. To create a new directory click on the new
"Create Directory" link.

A directory requires a name and an optional description. The name cannot contain the '/' (forward slash) character.

### Move Files
Files and directories can be moved to different directories. To move files and/or directories select the 
">> Move Files" link. This will take you to a page where you can select the files and directories in the current
directory that you wish to move. Select the directory to move them to from the "Move to directory" dropdown. The
dropdown is searchable.

Moving a directory will recursively move everything underneath it. This can be an expensive operation.
