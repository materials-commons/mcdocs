# Projects
Everything in Materials Commons starts with a project. A project allows you to set up the list of collaborators
you are sharing your files with. It's where you will create your experiments, processes, samples, and publish your
data from. You can set up many projects in Materials Commons, allowing you to separate who you share your data with.
