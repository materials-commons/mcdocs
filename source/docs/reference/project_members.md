# Project Members

Projects have team members. The membership in a project controls access to the project. Team members have full access
to all the files and data in a project. Only a project owner can add or delete team members.

To add collaborators to your project click on the "Users" link in the sidebar. Then click on "Modify Users" to add or
remove users.

The users page allows you to add and remove users from your project. **Only users who already have a Materials Commons Account
can be added as collaborators**.

To add new users to your project select from the list on the left. To remove existing users click on the trash can next to their name in 
the right hand list. Only the project owner can add/remove users from a project.

The next step is to upload your files into Materials Commons.
