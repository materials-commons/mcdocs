# Samples
Samples represent the "things" you are conducting your research on. They can be real, for example a magnesium bar,
or virtual, such as a field matrix in a computational experiment. Your samples will have attributes, such as grain
size, and measurements of those attributes. In MaterialsCommons processes can operate on Samples.
