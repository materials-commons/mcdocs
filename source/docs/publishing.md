# Overview

MaterialsCommons allows you to publish your research online. You have control over what is published and can always edit
or change it as needed. You publish the research in a project. When you publishing using MaterialsCommons your files
are made available as a Zip archive as well as through Globus. You can have MaterialsCommons associate a DOI with your
published research. It will manage that DOI for you, including registration and ensuring it is in a searchable index.
In this way you can use DOI in a paper. This will allow readers of the paper to easily find your published data.

### Publishing your research

MaterialsCommons uses the term "Dataset" for published data. A dataset is a subset of the data in your project. It
is made up of the files, samples, processes, and workflows that you choose to publish. To publish your research
you will need to create a new dataset or modify an existing one. Clicking in the sidebar on the "Publish" link
will take you to a page listing your current datasets. You can create new datasets from this page.

Clicking on "+ Create Dataset" allows you to create a new dataset. Clicking on existing datasets gives you the
opportunity to edit an existing dataset.
