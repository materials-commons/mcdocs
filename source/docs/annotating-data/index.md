# Loading A Spreadsheet

If you have already uploaded a spreadsheet then the create experiment page will also present a dropdown of spreadsheets
you can load.

Materials Commons supports loading spreadsheets to create experiments. This has the advantage of working with your existing
data. With a few small modifications to your spreadsheet Materials Commons can create your samples, processes and even your
workflow.

Your spreadsheet will be loaded in the background by Materials Commons. When the load is complete you will receive an email.
