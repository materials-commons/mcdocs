# Processes
Processes represent the steps you take in your experiment. Processes operate on Samples and Files. Processes are the
steps you represent in your workflow. An example of a process in a experiment is Annealing. Processes have attributes
that describe things about the process. The Annealing process might have both a Time and a Temperature attribute
associated with it.
