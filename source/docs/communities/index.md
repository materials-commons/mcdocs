# Commmunities Of Practice

Communities of Practice are a way to create a community in Materials Commons. A Community of Practice (CoP) contains
related datasets, as well as files and links that are relevant to a community. The files and links is a useful way
to specify different standards and practices in the community, link to a discussion board and/or email list, and share
other items of importance.
