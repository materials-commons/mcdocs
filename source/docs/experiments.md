# Experiments
Experiments allow you to break your research into individual chunks. Experiments are a convenient way to organize your
research. Experiments are composed of files, samples, and processes from your project. You can share data across 
experiments. For example a process, sample and/or file may exist in more than one experiment in your project.

A project can have 1 or more experiments. Experiments are listed both on the project page, and under the Experiments
link in the side nav.
